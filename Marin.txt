Gundam Freedom ZGMF-X10A

One of ZAFT's ZGMF-X series of Gundam units build in CE 71 using technology
 derived from the four captured Alliance's Gundam, the Freedom Gundam has 
Phase Shift Armor and its armaments include CIWS guns, beam sabers, shield, 
plasma beam cannons, railguns, and a beam rifle. When the latter three weapons 
are used simultaneously, the Freedom is said to be in 'Full Burst Mode'.
 The suit has full flight capabilities in the atmosphere and the back-mounted wings
 can be deployed in "High Mobility Aerial Tactics (HiMAT) Mode" to enhance its mobility
 in the atmosphere or in space. It also has an advanced targeting system, the Multi Lock-On System,
 that allows it to target and fire at multiple enemy units simultaneously. Due to its capabilities 
and loadout, the suit has a reputation as a specialized 'Mobile Suit Killer', but its high performance
 resulted in a complicated control system that demands extremely fast reaction speed and spatial awareness from its pilot
